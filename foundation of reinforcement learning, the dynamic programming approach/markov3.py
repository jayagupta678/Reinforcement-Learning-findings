The process is in s0 90% of the time and it can
 move to s1 the remaining 10% of the time. 
When the process is in state s1 it will remain 
there 50% of the time. Given this data we
can create a Transition Matrix T as follow:
    
    
Letâ€™s suppose we have to guess were the process 
will be after 3 steps and after 50 steps. 
How can we do it? We are interested in chains 
that have a finite number of states and are 
time-homogeneous meaning that the transition matrix
does not change over time.Given these assumptions 
we can compute the k-step transition probability as 
the k-th power of the transition matrix
